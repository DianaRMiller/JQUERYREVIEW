Files in Jquery Code review
----------------------------------------------------------------

The framework has a few files you should check out. Every file
contains lots of (hopefully) clarifying comments.

* stylesheet.css
  This is the main file of the style of the page. This is what makes
  the page look nice!

* bootstrap.css
  This file sets more styles into your html, so that printed versions
  of your site looks better than they usually would. It should be
  included on every page.

* scripts.js
  This file sets up the interaction between you and the page to create your Mad Libs. It allows you
  to input the information in a blank form and at the end it will show your own personal Mad Libs
  when you click 'submit'.

* README.md
  This file tells you more about my project, what programs I used and how to interact with it.
  Have fun!
